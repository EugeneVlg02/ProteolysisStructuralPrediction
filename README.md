# About
This method estimates the structural susceptibility of protein regions to proteolysis based on the known three-dimensional structure of a protein.

# Dependencies
For the correct work of the method, you need to install the following software:
* [Clustal Omega](http://www.clustal.org/omega/)
* [DSSP](https://github.com/PDB-REDO/dssp) 
* [UCSF Chimera](https://github.com/insilichem/pychimera/blob/master/docs/install.rst)

and the following python libraries:

* Biopython
* pandas
* numpy
* requests
